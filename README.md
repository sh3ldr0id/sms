ðŸ‘‰ For a true MVP, Iâ€™d suggest **start with just 3 modules**:
**Inventory + Sales + Billing**. Thatâ€™s the minimum viable loop. Customers, employees, and logistics can be added iteratively.

Would you like me to design this MVP plan for **a small shop (like a grocery, pharmacy)** or for a **larger retail store with employees and logistics**?
